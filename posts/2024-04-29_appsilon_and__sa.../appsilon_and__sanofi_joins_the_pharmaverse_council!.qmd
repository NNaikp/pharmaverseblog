<!--------------- post begins here ----------------->

We are excited to announce that **Appsilon** and **Sanofi** will take up the remaining two council seats on the pharmaverse council!

Appsilon will on the council be represented by **[Damian Rodziewicz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/drodziewicz/)** and Sanofi by **[Andre Couturier](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andre-couturier-1800b447/)**.

# Appsilon and Open Source

Appsilon is the maintainer of the [`rhino`](https://appsilon.github.io/rhino/) package already on the pharmaverse package rooster. Appsilon also powers the popular [ShinyConf](https://www.shinyconf.com/) and are involved in the pilot submissions to FDA through the R consortium working group ["R for submission"](https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/).


# Sanofi and Open Source

Sanofi recently became a member of the R consortium and have in recent years invested heavily in the adoption of R internally. In line with the pharmaverse goal, Sanofi is committed to the adoption and further development of open source software in the pharma industry. This is evident through Sanofi's contributions to [`falcon`](https://pharmaverse.github.io/falcon/) and [`riskmetric`](https://pharmar.github.io/riskmetric/) and their [extension](https://phuse.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/Archive/2024/Connect/US/Bethesda/PAP_ET10.pdf) of the [`teal`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/teal/latest-tag/) framework.


We are excited to further develop the open source eco-system for pharma!

On behalf of the council,
Ari Siggaard Knoph
